On November 13<sup>th</sup>, I  presented a webcast for [O'Reilly][oreilly] about [using messaging protocols to build mobile and web applications][webcast].

This webcast can be watched for free or you can read the [slides][slides] that were used for the presentation. They contain most of the information I talked about during this 1-hour long webcast.

Thanks to the people at O'Reilly (and especially Yasmina Greco) to setup this presentation, it was a great and fun experience.
