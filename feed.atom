      On November 13^th^, I will present a webcast for O&#39;Reilly about Using Messaging Protocols to Build Mobile and Web Applications:
      
      
      The use of mobile devices is increasing and widening. Not only smart phones and tablets are connected to the internet but also automation devices, car systems, etc. Even though these devices are increasingly powerful, they still have some constraints unknown from desktop devices; they have limited battery life and intermittent network availability requiring efficient protocols to communicate with other devices and servers in a reliable efficient way.

      &lt;p&gt;On November 13^th^, I will present a webcast for &lt;a href=&quot;http://oreilly.com&quot;&gt;O'Reilly&lt;/a&gt; about &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oreilly.com/pub/e/3151&quot;&gt;Using Messaging Protocols to Build Mobile and Web Applications&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The use of mobile devices is increasing and widening. Not only smart phones and tablets are connected to the internet but also automation devices, car systems, etc. Even though these devices are increasingly powerful, they still have some constraints unknown from desktop devices; they have limited battery life and intermittent network availability requiring efficient protocols to communicate with other devices and servers in a reliable efficient way.&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;The messaging technology enables us to overcome some of these constraints by providing protocols that efficiently use the most critical resources (network bandwidth and memory) guaranteeing the data will be effectively delivered even in the event of network connectivity loss.&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;In this webcast, we will take a look at messaging concepts and present two simple messaging protocols, STOMP and MQTT to build simple mobile (iOS) and Web applications.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/blockquote&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;Registration is &lt;em&gt;free&lt;/em&gt; and the webcast will last approximatively 1 hour (40 minutes of presentations and 20 of questions).&lt;/p&gt;

      I have agreed with O&#39;Reilly Media to write a book titled Mobile &amp; Web Messaging.
      
      The book will be an introduction to the concepts of messaging protocols (and how they differ from request/reply protocols) targeted for mobile and Web developers.
      
      Messaging protocols have been used for a long time in the enterprise software (such as JMS on Java platform) and they start to permeate in mobile and Web environments.
      
      These environments have different characteristics from enterprise environments and the messaging protocols targeted for them differ from enterprise messaging protocols.

      &lt;p&gt;This is a long dream come true as I always wanted to write a book. I often joke that I prefer to write about code than  write code... It's time to show that I mean it.&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;I am grateful that my employer, &lt;a href=&quot;http://redhat.com&quot;&gt;Red Hat&lt;/a&gt;, kindly accepted to let me spend some of my work time working on this book.&lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;News about the book will be posted &lt;a href=&quot;.&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and on Twitter:&lt;/p&gt;
